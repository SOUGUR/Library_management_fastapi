# Library_management_FastAPI

Welcome to the LibraryFastAPI project! This project is a web application built using FastAPI, designed to manage a library's book inventory, user roles, and interactions. It allows users to view available books, add new books, and remove books based on user roles.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and role-based access control for users (e.g., Librarian, Superuser).
- **Book Management**: 
  - View available books with details such as title, author, and available copies.
  - Add new books to the inventory.
  - Remove books from the inventory (restricted to Librarians and Superusers).
- **Responsive UI**: A user-friendly interface that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **RESTful API**: Utilizes FastAPI to create a RESTful API for seamless interaction with the frontend.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy with SQLite (or another database of your choice)
